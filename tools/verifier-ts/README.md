# @odc/verifier-ts — second, independent ODC export verifier (TypeScript)

A standalone CLI that verifies an ODC NDJSON export against the frozen
`contracts/`. It is the **TypeScript** counterpart to the Go verifier: the two
are built in hard-isolated contexts from `contracts/` alone, so that agreement
between them is agreement about the _spec_, not a shared author's reading. This
package therefore imports **no** workspace package. Its only third-party runtime
dependency is `@noble/curves`, used **only** for the ET-4c prime-order subgroup
check (the one check `node:crypto` cannot do); every other primitive —
SHA-256, the Ed25519 verify predicate, the ET-4a/ET-4b integer comparisons — is
Node standard library.

## Usage

```sh
pnpm --filter @odc/verifier-ts build
node dist/src/cli.js verify <export.ndjson> [--head <64-lowercase-hex>]
```

Output and process exit codes (the exit code is **not** conformance-checked —
`evolution.md` EV-17 pins conformance on the verdict token and line number(s)
alone — but the CLI note fixes this scheme so the two verifiers agree):

| Verdict                | stdout                  | exit |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ---- |
| VALID                  | `VALID`                 | 0    |
| INVALID (line N)       | `INVALID at line N`     | 1    |
| PARTIAL (lines …)      | `PARTIAL at lines a, b` | 2    |
| tool error (bad args…) | message on stderr       | ≥ 3  |

`--head` supplies the out-of-band anchored head. It is the ONLY way to detect
clean end-truncation, which is invisible from the export alone
(`export-format.md` EX-16): a prefix of a valid chain is itself a valid chain.

## What it checks

Two stages, per `evolution.md` EV-6/EV-15:

- **Stage A (type-agnostic, every line):** NDJSON framing and the single
  canonical byte form of each line (`export-format.md`), envelope well-formedness
  and strict rejection (`event-schema.md`), `seq` contiguity, `ts` calendar
  validity, `prev_hash` linkage, and `hash` recomputation over the byte-exact
  preimage (`hashing.md`). Parsing is done on the raw bytes, **not** via
  `JSON.parse`, which would silently accept duplicate keys, `1e2`/`1.0`, and lose
  key order.
- **Stage B (per registered `(type, version)`):** payload key-set, Ed25519
  signatures under the type's named key (with the ET-4a/ET-4b canonical-encoding
  and ET-4c prime-order checks run on the raw bytes _before_ the verify
  primitive), title/`choice_count`/`choice` bounds, the `ballot_batch_interval_ms`
  and `ballot_batch_min` floors an `issue_created` declares (ET-14b), and `issue_id`
  back-references. A well-formed but unregistered `(type, version)` yields
  `PARTIAL` for that line, never `INVALID` (EV-8).

## Tests

```sh
pnpm --filter @odc/verifier-ts test
```

Three files, and the split between them is deliberate — **`contracts/fixtures/`
is the sole oracle for what a given input verifies to.** Only the first file
below asserts a verdict value; the other two assert that a verdict of the right
_shape_ came back at all. Anything that froze an expected verdict outside the
fixture corpus would be inventing conformance in a file no reviewer treats as
normative.

- **`test/fixtures.test.ts`** — drives every vector in
  `contracts/fixtures/index.json` and asserts the declared verdict token and
  line number(s) only. This is the conformance suite.
- **`test/robustness.test.ts`** — regression pins for the two unbounded
  `f(...array)` defects found in the T7b review (`Math.min(...invalidLines)` and
  `String.fromCodePoint(...cps)`). Node throws `RangeError` once a spread array
  passes ~130k elements.
- **`test/extreme-values.test.ts`** — value-level fuzzing for that same class.
  Generates structurally valid exports carrying extreme values (huge strings
  where byte length, code point count and UTF-16 length diverge; integers
  straddling 2^53; extreme line counts; deep nesting; many-key payloads) and
  asserts only that the verifier does not throw and returns exactly one
  well-formed verdict of the three (EV-17). Generation is a fixed-seed LCG, so a
  failure reproduces from the case index in the assertion message.

**Why the last two exist as a category.** Both known defects of this class were
**wrong-verdict** bugs, not crashes-only: one returned no verdict at all, and
the other was swallowed by a catch-all as a silent `INVALID` on a line that
parses fine. A byte-level fuzzer cannot find them — flipping bytes in a valid
export does not grow the input, so it never reaches the limit. If you add a call
that spreads an array whose length comes from the input, add a case here.

**Not yet covered: the Go verifier.** `extreme-values.test.ts` fuzzes this
implementation only. The equivalent for `services/verifier/` is owed and is not a
port — Go has no argument-spread limit, so the analogous risks are stack growth
on deep nesting and `bufio.Scanner`'s token limit on long lines.
