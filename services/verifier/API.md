# verifier — interface

The verifier is a command-line tool, not a network service. Its "API" is the CLI
surface and the verdict contract of `contracts/evolution.md` EV-7/EV-17.

## Invocation

```
verify <export.ndjson> [--head <hash>]
```

- `<export.ndjson>` — path to the export file, read as **raw bytes**. Framing
  and canonical-form rules operate on the exact bytes; the file is never
  re-encoded or normalized.
- `--head <hash>` — optional expected chain head, 64 lowercase hex characters
  (`--head=<hash>` is also accepted). When given, after all link checks pass the
  last line's `hash` must equal it (EX-15); otherwise the chain is `INVALID` at
  its last line (EX-19). Without `--head`, clean end-truncation is undetectable
  (EX-16) and reports `VALID`.

## Output

One verdict line on stdout:

- `VALID`
- `INVALID at line N: <advisory reason>`
- `PARTIAL at lines N, M, …`

The reason text and the specific normative-sentence identifiers in it are
**advisory** (EV-17). Conformance is judged on the verdict token and the line
number(s) alone.

## Exit codes

| Verdict / condition            | Exit |
| ------------------------------ | ---- |
| `VALID`                        | 0    |
| `INVALID`                      | 1    |
| `PARTIAL`                      | 2    |
| Tool-level error (usage, I/O)  | ≥ 3  |

Exit codes follow the non-normative CLI note of EV-17; they are pinned for
cross-implementation consistency but are not themselves conformance-checked. A
tool-level error (bad usage, unreadable file, malformed `--head`) is never a
chain verdict.

## What is checked

Two stages (EV-6):

- **Stage A (structural, type-agnostic)** — applies to every event: NDJSON
  framing (EX-1..EX-6, EX-20), the canonical compact line form and minimal
  string escaping (EX-7..EX-10), envelope well-formedness and strict rejection
  (ES-1..ES-4), `seq` form/range/contiguity (ES-5..ES-8), `type` character set
  (ES-10), `version ≥ 1` (ES-12), payload flatness of int/string values
  (ES-15..ES-17, EV-16) with keys sorted and unique (EX-8, HA-6), `ts` syntax +
  calendar (ES-20), `prev_hash`/`hash` linkage and format (ES-23..ES-26), hash
  recomputation (HA-14), genesis position (ES-33), and the `--head` check
  (EX-15).
- **Stage B (semantic, per registered `(type, version)`)** — signatures and
  their Ed25519 canonical/prime-order gates (ET-3..ET-5, ET-4a/ET-4b/ET-4c),
  payload key sets (ES-18), key formats (ET-9b, ID-3), `chain_id` derivation
  (ET-7), title bounds and forbidden characters (ET-14), `choice_count` range
  (ET-14a), the ballot batching parameters and their floors (ET-14b),
  `issue_id` back-reference (ET-18/ID-8), and `choice` range (ET-18a).

The v1 registry is the four types `genesis`, `participant_registered`,
`issue_created`, `vote_cast`, each at `version` 1 (ET-1/ET-2). A well-formed but
unregistered `(type, version)` yields `PARTIAL` for that line, never `INVALID`
(EV-8/EV-9).
