## Current phase

**Phase 0 — Contracts.** Nothing may be implemented in services/ until
contracts/ passes the genesis rehearsal and is frozen.

## Done

- Charter and implementation plan finalized (docs/).
- Monorepo scaffolded: skills, agents, memory, toolchain stubs (2026-07-18).
- **T1 — local hooks + PR template + workspace hygiene** (2026-07-19, PR #1,
  squash `874bb4f`). lefthook (pre-commit format+lint on staged files,
  check-mode blocking ~1.6s; pre-push tests of changed services), prettier +
  eslint (typescript-eslint) flat config at root, `format`/`format:check`/
  `typecheck` scripts. `contracts/`, the Go verifier, and mockups excluded from
  both tools. Reviewed APPROVE WITH NITS; both [SHOULD]s fixed pre-merge.
- Repo is public at github.com/Will-ODC/odc, remote set, default branch
  **master** (docs say master everywhere; do not assume `main`).
- **T2 — CI skeleton** (2026-07-19, PR #2, squash `fff12c4`). `repo.yml`
  (format/lint/typecheck + diff-size fail>800/warn>400 + guard-tests) and
  `contracts-guard.yml`. Guard enforces, on any `contracts/` touch, a
  `CONTRACTS-CHANGE.md` entry + a per-spec `Version:` bump; `hashing.md` and
  `fixtures/` hard-freeze once the `contracts-v1` tag exists. Guard runs on
  every PR (skips clean when no contracts change) so it is safe as a required
  check. Convention introduced: each `contracts/*.md` spec carries a `Version:`
  line — T3/T4 authors must include it. Reviewed APPROVE WITH NITS; both
  [SHOULD]s (per-file version check; guard-tests required) fixed pre-merge.
- CI fix (2026-07-22, PR #5): `diff-size` now exempts `**/*.md` from the
  changed-line count (specs/docs are governed by review, not a code budget) —
  unblocked T3/T4's large spec diffs.
- **T3 — event-schema.md, ids.md, event-types.md** (2026-07-22, PR #4). Seven-
  field envelope (`ES-1…ES-33`), strict reject-don't-repair, flat int/string
  payloads; content-addressed `participant_id`/`issue_id`; v1 type registry
  (`genesis`, `participant_registered`, `issue_created`, `vote_cast`).
  Receipt-free ballots (ADR-0004): `vote_cast` registrar-signed, no
  voter-held key. ADRs 0002–0004 accepted; ADR-0005 (correction/retraction)
  drafted proposed pending ratification. Reviewed APPROVE WITH NITS (one
  [SHOULD], ES-5 sign/range contradiction, fixed pre-merge).
- **T4 — hashing.md, export-format.md, read-api.md, evolution.md** (2026-07-24,
  PR #6). Byte-exact preimage (DOMAIN + BE ints + length-prefixed strings +
  generic per-type-agnostic payload rule), SHA-256 lowercase hex; canonical
  NDJSON line form; `GET /events` pagination; additive-only evolution rule.
  Real hand-verifiable genesis worked example (seeds fixture 001, T5). Same
  PR ratifies **ADR-0005** (envelope never carries correction machinery —
  corrections are additive payload conventions) and accepts **ADR-0006**
  (two-stage verification + `PARTIAL` verdict for well-formed-but-unregistered
  types, generic payload preimage) — both pre-freeze gates from
  `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` are now closed. `contracts/` stays DRAFTING; freeze
  still gated on genesis rehearsal (T6–T8) + security audit (T9).

## Next

**T5 — Fixture generator + golden fixtures (TypeScript)** (`odc-implementer`),
per `docs/plans/phase-0.md`. Nothing blocks it: T4 merged, both pre-freeze
ADRs (0005, 0006) resolved. `tools/fixtures-gen/` generates one vector per
numbered normative sentence in T3/T4 specs + the adversarial set; golden
values never regenerate to make anything pass (`odc-testing`). Then T6
(rehearsal chain builder) → T7 (Go verifier, fresh-context isolation) → T8
(rehearsal loop) → T9 (security audit) → T10 (freeze).

Ticket discipline: one ticket = one branch = one PR = one session; fresh-context
review before merge; squash-merge. **STATE.md update note:** branch protection
now blocks direct pushes to master, so this file can no longer be committed
straight to master — update it in a small follow-up PR right after the ticket
merges (still separate from the feature branch, so parallel agents don't
conflict). Required checks to go green: `format / lint / typecheck`,
`diff-size`, `guard-tests`, `guard`.

## Blockers

- None for T5. Branch protection is **ON** (2026-07-19, ruleset
  `protect-master`): PR required, four status checks strict, linear history, no
  bypass. Both Phase-0 user actions are complete — T2's documented rules are
  now actually enforced.
